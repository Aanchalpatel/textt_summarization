This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.Â 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.A teenager who fell ill with flu four months ago is unable to move her arms and legs and can barely eat or talk. Miss Willard's family are unsure how the teenager became ill so suddenly, just four days after she returned her feeling unwell. Natasha Willard was studying for her A levels at college when she appeared to get the flu just before Christmas and her condition has worsened, leaving her unable to move her limbs and barely able to speak . Her stepmother Kirsty Willard said:Â 'The doctors are baffled, they do not know what happened. Mrs Willard said doctors have told them they are unsure whether she will make progress, but have warned the family she is unlikely to fully return to herself. Natasha, from Cwmbran, was studying art and Welsh in the sixth form at Torfaen's Llantarnam School when she fell ill. Encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain. Over the next few days Miss Willard started vomiting and had aches and pains, and her family presumed she had the flu. 'She can say a few words,' said Mrs Willard. Mrs Willard said they are having to teach the 17-year-old everything from scratch, as if she is a child again. Mrs Willard, who works in a bar, said they are worried about the reaction of people when the teenager is discharged from hospital. Performance remained the same after resting for several hours, while levels of glycogen - used by muscles as â€˜fuelâ€™ - were actually slightly higher after fast food was eaten as a recovery food. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. In the study, 11 male athletes were asked to fast for 12 hours, before a 90-minute endurance workout. They were then given meals of either fast food or supplements.Â Two hours after the second meal, all participants were then ask to ride 12 miles on a stationary bike - and performance for all was the same . â€˜These data indicate that short-term food options to initiate glycogen resynthesis can include dietary options not typically marketed as sports nutrition products such as fast food menu items,â€™ the researchers wrote.
